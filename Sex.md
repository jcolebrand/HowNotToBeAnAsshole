#Sex

You might think this belongs in the same place as *Relationship* but you would be wrong. The two have almost nothing to do with one another. Well that's not fair, relationships need a lot of sex, but sex does not mean relationship. 

Wanna get better at sex?

Yeah, I get it, you're pretty good at sex.

Wanna get better?

Talk about it.

Talk about it with your friends. Talk about it with strangers (but for the love of Pete -and Pete's a nice guy- establish a rapport with them first).

Ask questions.

Then take those answers and ask yourself "does that make sense? Do I have more to learn here? Can anatomy really work that way? Can I really stuff that up my ass?" and ask again.

Do not get your sex advice from a magazine, it will always be wrong.

Tips for sex:

Pee before sex. Maybe like 5-10 minutes before.  
If you want someone to felate you, wash your ass before asking them to do so. At the very least use a wet cloth on your asscrack before you disrobe.  
If you want someone to felate you, felate them first.  
Pee after sex. Maybe like 10-15 minutes after.
Talk about the sex and what you enjoyed. Listen to your partner tell you what they enjoyed.  
Ask your partner what they want in sex.  Give it to them.  
Have sex with more people, because they will teach you things you didn't know you didn't know. You will enjoy it.
