#Relationships

You might think this belongs in the same place as *Sex* but you would be wrong. The two have almost nothing to do with one another. Well that's not fair, relationships need a lot of sex, but sex does not mean relationship. This is the first basis of the errors of our culture. Let's start here shall we?

A relationship is a thing you have with another person. 

A relationship can be a friendship, it can be a sexual partnership over a course of time. It can be something that happens over the internet. It can be passing, it can be long running, it can be deep.

The demise of Western Culture is a reduction of our understanding of the words we use because the complexity of a large vocaulary is too hard for some people to comprehend. So we reduce. We remove. We excise and cut out. We deplete. We dwindle down. This leaves us with less words to choose from. So when we finally get to a word like Relationship, we lose sight of what it means, or how to define it. 

Or more commonly, once we have defined it for ourself, we forget that others won't use this word in the same way. All too often I encounter people who believe that they are using the same words as everyone else. When I ask people to take a moment and make sure I am using the same word they are, I frequently get looked at as tho I am a savage suggesting that they are all foreign. I frequently get told "please quit talking down to me" which is a polite way of saying "Cole your tone is too aggressive and slow, the way you phrase your words and the tone you use makes me feel like you are doing me a remedial service". Let's be honest, I am, but only because I think faster than the others around me. If you've never thought to yourself "Cole sure is talking down to me" then congratulations, your brain is sufficiently adept that you can make it clear how you're communicating in my world.

_Ahh_, I can hear you say, _I see why people have some issue with how you communicate Cole. You obviously think you're better than them._ which couldn't be further from the truth. I am not better than other people *in general*. Let's be clear. I am better at math than most people in Western Culture. I have a minor on my degree in Applied Mathematics. I have studied math more rigorously than most people care. This is evident in pop culture when people can't be arsed to understand a basic mathematical principle. I'm not inventing something here. So, I am better, on average, than most people at math. I'm better than a lot of people at math. I would rate myself in the top 20% of people in Western Culture at math. Not at an 80% understanding of all mathematical principles, mind you, but better at the math that people will generally come across in everything but the most technical areas. I can do statistics and follow them, I can do calculus and follow it, I can do set math and follow it, I can do set calculus and follow it, and at this point we lose people. This does not make me "better than you". This just makes me "better at math than you". 

Likewise I am better than you at a great many things.

But let's look at what I'm not great at: I'm not great at sports (I don't even try), I'm not great at baking (I could learn, but I focus my skills in other areas). I'm not great at poetry, or oration (yet), fishing, gardening (I have green thumbs when I use a can of spray paint), painting for that matter, or any of dozens of other activities. I can't play music (yet) or speak a foreign language fluently.

> Everybody is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid.

I have no problem owning up to this philosophy. I firmly live by it.

So when I tell you that I am better than you, I mean _in some area_. That's how specialization works. It is the height of Western Culture that I should do so, that I should specialize and be better than you at something.

But the things I'm good at are scientific, and I tend to be precise, and I tend to need people to be precise as well. I work in a field (ah, we come back to relationships, you thought I had forgotten them didn't you, and went back and checked the section header, but I didn't, I assure you) where it is a requirement to keep the entirety of a problem space in your head.
