#Racism

On June 17, 2015 a confused young man Dylann Roof (21) was suspected and aprehended in the shootings of 9 people in the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, SC. This prompted various people to espouse messages of support, hate, and confusion across various social media outlets. Personally I felt that as a matter of upbringing I had been exposed to relentless racist episodes and people with a lot of racism in their blood. I know that this is a level of indoctrination that I have to live beyond in my daily life. I can't accept that "that's just how things are in the South". I have to live better than that.

So I came across an image on twitter, unattributed (and poorly captured, not reproduced here, source: https://twitter.com/Phylan/status/611556765138878464) that read with this text:

Here's the thing tho: ... he's racist.

Can't we call it that? Is that so wrong? Telling racist jokes is the behavior of a racist. Let's be honest.

I think that I should be able to make a joke in poor taste and have it not be well received, and that the right to free speech is the right to get called out for being a dumbass when I open my mouth and say something stupid. I had the right to say it. I also had the right to look like an idiot and have someone call me out on it.

And you lot make sure you call me out when I say something dumb. I don't learn when you bite your tongue. Be my neighbor, be my friend, and tell me when I do something stupid.
