Books that I think you should read to understand me:

Asimov's Foundation series
Asimov's Robot series (including the shorts)

Heinlein's Stranger in a Strange Land (Yes I am one of *those* hippies)

978-0061090868 Power in the Blood by Greg Matthews 

The entirety of the Dragonriders of Pern series

Enders Game and the rest of the saga (beware the highly conservative values of the author and the rampant hatred he lets shine through at times and learn from it)
