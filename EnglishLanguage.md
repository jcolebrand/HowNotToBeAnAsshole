#The English Language

What is love?

Which one of 17 emotions do you associate with love?

I love my father.

I love my mother.

I love my sister.

There is apparently little lost love between my estranged brother and myself, over what I understand to be an imagined slight.

I love my dog.

I love my exes.

I love my girlfriend.

I love my laptop.

I love my books and movies and TV and Netflix.

And yet almost all of these are different from one another, and almost all have varying strengths or intensities.

So why do we use the same word for all of them? 

English is a bitch of a language.
