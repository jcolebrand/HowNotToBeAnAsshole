#Church

I'm not gonna call this religion, because it isn't about religion. This is about church. This is about organized religion, but not about religion.

Fucking words. So complicated. Cole, can't you just call it "those infidels and their bullshit" if you're gonna bag on something and let's be done with it?

No, I can't. 

Here's the deal: You're all doing it wrong.

Well, most of you. A damned sight lot of you out there are getting it completely wrong.

Some of you get it right, but you are probably doing that by accident.

This is a good time for you to go pour a glass of whiskey and drop an ice cube in it and swish it around and think about what I'm going on about, because I'm gonna make you mad. It's ok, Jesus drank. The pope drinks. Monks drink. Muslims drink. Buddhists may not drink, but that's just because they get it right. But I digress. We were talking about why Church drives me fucking crazy and why I can't abide it.

Let's start with the hypocrisy. _Oh, Cole, my church doesn't have *any* hypocrisy. We are all loving people._ 

Yeah, go read my section on Racism. I assure you, you're getting it wrong. Or at least, the Church you're a part of is.
