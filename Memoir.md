This whole fucking thing is my memoir. I will cuss in it. I will talk about sensitive things. I will reveal bits of myself. I will say silly shit. I won't make sense. I will contradict myself. I will make you mad. I will make you put the book down.

If I don't do one or more of those things, I have let you down.

Oh, and before you go too much further, I love you. I really do. But we'll get to that.
